# Creating API's with Javascript

Creating api's with javascript is not hard but sometimes not easy, this repo will show you what a API made with javascript looks like
I made one using the javascript package called 'express' and utilizing the API via node-fetch

**PACKAGES**                
express - npm install express
node-fetch - npm install node-fetch

**NOTE**
Make sure index.js is on or/ debugging before using usingAPI.js otherwise you'll get a error
Index.js for main API code
usingAPI.js to use the API

This API is hosted on the local host you may research further on how to host this api on a website.
